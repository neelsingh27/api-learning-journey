#What is an API?
1. API stands for Application Programming Interface, which acts as a communication interface between an application and its server.
2. Basically, an API communicates the request made by the application to the server and takes the server's response back to the application.
3. When an application needs some data or wants a server to act, it sends a request through an API. The server processes the request and sends a response back through the API.
4. In technical terms, an API is the link between the frontend and the backend of any web application, but APIs are not limited to frontend/backend communication. APIs can allow:
    Frontend → Backend
    Backend → Database/service
    Application → External service
    Application → Application
5. In short, an API = A way for different software components to communicate with each other.

##Why APIs Exist?
1. To let different software systems talk to each other safely and easily without needing to know how the other system is built.
2. Communication: They act as a bridge so separate apps can share information and commands.
3. Hiding Complexity: You only need to know what to ask for, not how the inner code works (like ordering food from a menu without cooking it yourself).

## HTTP Methods Used with APIs-
1. GET API: Used when an application requests anything from the server. It is a web service method used exclusively (only) to retrieve data from a server.
2. POST API: Used to send data to the server. It sends data to a server to create a new resource or trigger an action.
3. PATCH API: Used to apply partial modifications to an existing resource. Whereas the PUT API completely changes the entire resource.
4. PUT API: Used to completely replace an existing resource or create a new resource at a specific, known URL. 
5. DELETE API: Used to remove or delete a specific resource from a server or database.

##API Hitting-
1. "Hitting an API" means sending a request from one software application to another to retrieve data or trigger an action. 
2. The server processes the request and sends back a response, which usually contains the requested data or information about whether the action was successful.
3. The response also includes a Status Code, such as: 200 → Request successful, 404 → Resource not found, 401 → Unauthorised, 500 → Server error, etc.
4. Whenever we hit an API, we get many types of API responses, commonly using formats such as JSON or XML, with JSON being very common in modern web APIs.
4.1 JSON format (key-value pairs) and the other in XML format (Extensible Markup Language).
5. We cannot hit an API directly; we will need a protocol for them to hit. Most web APIs are accessed using HTTP/HTTPS requests.
